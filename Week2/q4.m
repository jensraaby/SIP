% The image interference.tif has been corrupted by noise and a systematic 
% interference pattern. Please describe the noise and inference patterns 
% and develop, implement, describe, and apply a program for removing as 
% much of the noise and interference pattern as possible. 
% Show (and explain) the results. The program need not to be fully 
% automatic, but may include interactive input, e.g. using the MATLAB-function ginput.

% discuss noise, low frequency patterns. use the frequency spectrums to
% help analysis
