% Implement the Gaussian lowpass and high pass filter (GW Sec. 4.8.3 and 
% 4.9.3) and apply it to the barbara.tif image. Evaluate the filtering 
% result on couple of cut-off frequencies and explain the results you get. 

% Then using the Gaussian high pass filter, implement a high-frequency 
% emphasis filter for sharpening an image. Try to invert your low-pass 
% filtered result above by filtering it with the high-frequency emphasis
% filter (GW Sec. 4.9.5). Explain the results you get. Is the inversion feasible?
